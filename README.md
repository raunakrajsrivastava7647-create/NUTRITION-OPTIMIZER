# 🥗 Food Waste → Nutrition Optimizer  

### _A Sustainable Redistribution Simulation using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib & Streamlit_

---

## 📘 Overview

**Food Waste → Nutrition Optimizer** is a **data-driven simulation model** that demonstrates how recoverable food waste can be redistributed across regions to **reduce nutritional deficits**.

It models **inter-regional food surplus, deficit, transport loss, and recovery efficiency**, using a **greedy optimization algorithm**. The app visualizes the outcomes interactively, helping policymakers, researchers, and organizations explore solutions for **food security and resource optimization**.

Unlike typical economic or profit-driven projects, this model emphasizes **social impact**, **sustainability**, and **problem-solving for humanity**.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

Global food production exceeds nutritional demand, yet hunger persists due to **waste, inefficiency, and logistic gaps**.

This project simulates:

1. **Synthetic regions** with random food production and waste patterns.  
2. **Nutritional demand per person** to determine deficit and surplus zones.  
3. A **greedy allocation algorithm** that redistributes recoverable food waste from surplus to deficit regions, accounting for transport loss.

The system demonstrates how small improvements in **recovery rate** or **logistics optimization** can significantly enhance **nutritional coverage** — offering real-world implications for **policy**, **research**, and **sustainability studies**.
